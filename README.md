# fibonacci_numbers
Simple program that generates a Fibonacci number based on user input made in Rust.

To be able to use this program, execute this command (while you're in the project's folder):
```
$ cargo run --release
```

If the output says "command `cargo` was not found" or something like that, you need to install Rust. To do that, you can follow the official guide on how to install Rust (rustup) [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).
