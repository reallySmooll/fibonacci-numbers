# fibonacci_numbers
Simple program that generates a Fibonacci number based on user input made in Rust.

To be able to use this program, execute this command (while you're in the project's folder):
```
$ cargo run --release
```

If the output says that command `cargo` was not found or something like that, you need to install Rust. You can do that by following the official guide on how to install Rust (rustup).
